module Random.Pcg.Extra exposing (..)

{-| This module provides many common and general-purpose helper functions for
core's Random.Pcg library. You can find even more useful functions for a particular
type in the other modules.

# Constant Generators
@docs constant

# Maps
For `map` and `mapN` up through N=5, use the core library.
@docs map6, andMap

# New Generators
@docs oneIn, maybe, result, choice

# Working with Lists
@docs choices, frequency, sample, combine, rangeLengthList

# Filtered Generators
@docs filter

# andThenN
These functions are like `mapN` except the function you pass in does not return
an exact value, but instead another generator. That means you can take in several
random arguments to drive more randomness.

when creating complicated chained generators and you need to handle a simple
case. It's also useful for the base case of recursive generators.

      filter (\i -> i % 2 == 0) (int minInt maxInt)

**Warning:** If the predicate is unsatisfiable, the generator will not
terminate, your application will crash with a stack overflow, and you will be
sad. You should also avoid predicates that are merely very difficult to satisfy.

Note that this function takes values, not generators. That's because it's meant
to be a lightweight helper for a specific use. If you need to choose between two
generators, use `choices [gen1, gen2]`.

this is usually not a problem since you pass a list literal.

{-| Create a generator that chooses a generator from a list of generators
based on the provided weight. The likelihood of a given generator being
chosen is its weight divided by the total weight (which doesn't have to equal 1).
