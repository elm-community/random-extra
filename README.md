# elm-community/random-extra
This library includes lots of extra helper functions for the Random.Pcg module. It makes generating pseudo-random values much easier.

If you want to add one or find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/elm-community/random-extra/issues/new).

## Changelog
### 2.0.0
* Update dependencies for Elm 0.18.
* Remove `flatMap` as core's `andThen` is identical.
* Rename `flatMapN` to `andThenN`, for similar reasons.
* Rename `together` to `combine`; see #1.
* Change signature of `Random.Pcg.Extra.Float.normal`; see #2.
* Add `Random.Pcg.Extra.List` module; see #4.
